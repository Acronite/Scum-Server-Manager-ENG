# Vehicle Control System - SCUM Server Manager

## Overview

This system automatically monitors registered player vehicles and maintains an updated list of active vehicles per player. When a vehicle is destroyed, disappears, or becomes inactive, it is automatically removed from the player's list.

## Features

- âœ… **Automatic Monitoring:** Processes vehicle events in real-time
- âœ… **Individual Embeds:** Each player has their own Discord embed
- âœ… **Numbered List:** Vehicles organized in numbered list
- âœ… **Dynamic Colors:** Green for players with vehicles, red for without vehicles
- âœ… **Periodic Updates:** Checks for new events every 5 minutes
- âœ… **Duplicate Control:** Prevents processing duplicate events

## Processed Events

The system monitors and processes the following events:
- `Destroyed` - Vehicle destroyed
- `Disappeared` - Vehicle disappeared
- `VehicleInactiveTimerReached` - Inactivity timer reached

## Configuration

### Webhook
The `player-vehicles` webhook must be configured in `src/data/webhooks.json`:
```json
{
  "player-vehicles": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
}
```

### Check Interval
By default, the system checks for new events every 5 minutes. To change, modify the value in `src/vehicle_control_integration.js`:
```javascript
setInterval(() => {
    // ...
}, 5 * 60 * 1000); // 5 minutes
```

## Logs

The system generates detailed logs:
- Initialization with current records
- Event processing
- Vehicle removal
- Embed updates
- Errors and exceptions

## Maintenance

### Reinitialization
To reinitialize the system with current records:
```javascript
vehicleControl.vehicleControl.initializeFromRegistrations();
```

### Backup
Important files for backup:
- `src/data/players/player_vehicles.json`
- `src/data/vehicles/lastProcessedEvent.json`

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Embeds don't appear
- Check if webhook is configured correctly
- Check webhook permissions on Discord
- Check error logs

### Problem: Vehicles not being removed
- Check if events are being processed
- Check if `lastProcessedEvent.json` is being updated
- Check processing logs

### Problem: System doesn't start
- Check if all JSON files exist
- Check read/write permissions
- Check dependencies (axios)
